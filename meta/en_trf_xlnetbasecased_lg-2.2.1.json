  "description": "Provides weights and configuration for the pretrained transformer model `xlnet-base-cased`, published by CMU and Google Brain. The package uses HuggingFace's `transformers` implementation of the model. Pretrained transformer models assign detailed contextual word representations, using knowledge drawn from a large corpus of unlabelled text. You can use the contextual word representations as features in a variety of pipeline components that can be trained on your own data.",
  "notes": "Requires the `spacy-transformers` package to be installed. A CUDA-compatible GPU is advised for reasonable performance.",
